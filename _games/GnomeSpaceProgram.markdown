### Description:
Made for April fools 2025.

Ever wanted to strap a garden gnome to a rocket and launch it? Weird, but you can do that in this game anyways! The inspiration from this game might be more than obvious.

Gnome Space Program is free and open-source, so feel free to modify it. (However I would like to point out that some textures that I used don't allow commercial use. Check out the "TextureCredit" file in the textures folder for more information.)

## Downloads:
Extract these files wherever you want, though be careful with extracting the Windows download into your C drive as it will merge with the Windows folder inside of it.
