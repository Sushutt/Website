### Description:
Gun Shift is a game where the only way to move is with a gun. You must use your recoil to move yourself around 10 different levels all while fighting off varying enemies.

This game was developed in the span of 6 months, it was meant to be a short project but stuff quickly got into the way. This game likely will not recieve updates in the future.

### Download:
All you need to do to install this game is to extract the zip to whatever folder you want it in (but NOT directly into your C:/ drive if you're using windows!)

I would also like to point out that this game was developed natively for Linux. While I did make a windows release, I did not test the windows version as thoroughly and it may perform worse. Or better.
