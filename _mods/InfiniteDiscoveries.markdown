### Description:
This version of ID is no longer under development!
There is, however, an [actively maintained fork here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/228094-infinite-discoveries-ce-new-ui-name-system-maclinux-support/). I am not associated with this fork but I still think it's worth mentioning.

### Features:
* (Sorta) realistic star colours
* Planet texture generation (now revamped!)
* Scatterer and EVE support (including volumetrics!)
* Rings!
* Functional atmospheres
* Ocean and life generation depending on temperature
* Galaxy mode! Simply put the "Infinite_GalaxyMode" folder in GameData and every star (every star after 0.9.6 should orbit around a central black hole without needing to regenerate!)
* Customization, minimum or maximum star size, adjustable colours, etc...
* Fancy name generation!
* Rudimentary Parallax support
* Custom loading screens
* Tidally locked planets
* A custom sunflare!
