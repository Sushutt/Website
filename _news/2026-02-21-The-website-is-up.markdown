I don't know what I'm doing, so expect some nasty mistakes along the road because I don't know how to program websites!
This site was written with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). I really do not know what I am doing here.

### What this is:
If you want a quick answer, this is a website for the "brand" known as Sushut. I am a game studio, content creator, and whatever else I come up with in the meantime.

This site is intended as a hub for all my games, (archived) Kerbal Space Program mods, and any other whimsical ideas. However a good majority of this is just for fun. You will also be able to download some of my games / mods through this site. THOUGH NOT ALL! Any upcoming paid games won't be hosted here as I don't want to bother with all of that just yet.

(check out the [games](/games/) page after reading this!)

I do eventually want to try and make a forum if there's enough of a community to start that. I highly doubt that'll happen anytime soon though.
